 # 🚀 E-Commerce Backend Development Project 🛒 #

I recently completed an E-Commerce Backend project, built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, focusing on scalable, secure, and functional backend architecture. This solution provides a robust foundation for modern e-commerce platforms, enabling seamless user and product management.

📌 Key Features

🔒 User Authentication: Secure sign-up and sign-in functionalities using bcrypt.js for password hashing and JWT for token-based authentication.
📦 Product & Category Management: Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing categories and products, accessible to admin users.
🛍️ Shopping Cart: Real-time price calculations and seamless cart management for users.
👩‍💻 Admin Role Management: Role-based access control with dedicated privileges for administrators.
💥 Secure API Endpoints: All sensitive operations are safeguarded using JWT tokens and role-based access mechanisms.

📌 Technology Stack

Node.js & Express: For server-side development.
MongoDB with Mongoose: Database management.
JWT: For secure and scalable authentication.
bcrypt.js: To ensure password security through hashing.
